This is a sandbox, in the spirit of Cloudius Systems' OSv.

A single thread of execution pre-loads necessary data, runs a 32-bit
little endian Moxie ELF binary until it exits or a cycle budget is
exhausted.  Output, if any, is noted.

From the Moxie program's point of view, it is running as root and is
essentially the entire operating system kernel + application, all in
a single wrapper.
